============

Our idea is inspired by the work done by Richard Stallman and the GNU Project, the vast
majority of our project is going to be focused on the principles of the free software paradigm
(which shouldn't be confused with free of charge). As we said, our main source of inspiration
is the collection of essays of Richard Stallman: Free Software, Free Society (this book can be
downloaded for free from the GNU server).

We firmly believe that this equality should always be accomplished:
Software = Freedom + Collaboration + Creativity + Evolution
However, all of those nouns are often confused with free of charge software. Nevertheless, a
good software should be funded according to its quality and usefulness but the main goal must
remain the same: a contribution to the community which can be shared by everyone.

In order to full the conditions of free software and at the same time include the terms creativity,
evolution and funding within our idea we are going to develop a free-collaborative-creative-and-
evolutive software development community based on big projects and small features that will be
funded and rated by the community itself.
The community will be shaped as a website where two dierent kind of users will interact:
developers and contributors. Both of them are registered users, non-registered users will have a
more restricted view of the website.

==============

Free software permits students to learn how software works. Some students, on reach-
ing their teens, want to learn everything there is to know about their computer and
its software. They are intensely curious to read the source code of the programs that
they use every day. To learn to write good code, students need to read lots of code
and write lots of code. They need to read and understand real programs that people
really use. Only free software permits this. Proprietary software rejects their thirst
for knowledge: it says, \The knowledge you want is a secret|learning is forbidden!"
Free software encourages everyone to learn. The free software community rejects the
\priesthood of technology", which keeps the general public in ignorance of how tech-
nology works; we encourage students of any age and situation to read the source code
and learn as much as they want to know. Schools that use free software will enable
gifted programming students to advance.
